              Services ‍1. Space Reservation. Prked provides the Reservation
              Services to Users for the sole purposes of providing Users
              information on the location and apparent availability of parking
              and assisting them in securing parking at participating
              third-party parking locations, including but not limited to
              private driveways, private garages, and private lots. In response
              to a User’s online request for a reservation through the Prked
              Website or a Prked Application, User communicates directly with
              the applicable individual holding/operating said space (the Host
              of the Listing) regarding such reservation request. The
              availability of reservations is determined at the time of a User’s
              query, and Prked makes no representation or warranty (i) regarding
              the accuracy of any data (including, but not limited to,
              reservation availability data) received from any Host. Each Host
              is an independent third party and is not under the control of
              Prked. Prked is not a guarantor, agent, or otherwise affiliated
              with any Host. You acknowledge that each Host may have its own
              policies, terms, and conditions. Once a reservation request is
              made by a User through the Prked’s Website or any Prked
              Application, the Host with such space will provide confirmation of
              the Reservation to such User either by pre-authorizing the
              Services to auto accept all reservation requests within specified
              hours and specified days, or by manual approval at the time of
              request. By using the Reservation Services, you agree to receive
              reservation confirmations by Prked messaging after requesting a
              Reservation through the Reservation Services. You may terminate
              your Registration at any time by emailing Prked at
              help@Prked.com.In furtherance of (and not in any limitation of)

              the assistance that the Reservation Services provide to you in
              locating and reserving parking, the ultimate decision to utilize
              the parking information provided by the Reservation Services and
              to park at any location remains yours and yours alone, and you
              hereby agree to assume any risk inherent in utilizing the

              location. For the avoidance of doubt, Prked does not in any way

              locations. FURTHER, PRKED ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY
              FOR 1) THE SAFETY OF ANY PERSON, PROPERTY, OR VEHICLE PARKED AT

              LOCATION. USE OF, OR A RESERVATION THROUGH, ANY PRKED APPLICATION

              Host. You acknowledge and confirm that you are authorized and

              taxing jurisdictions. ‍3. Prices. The price of a parking
              reservation will be determined by the Host with the legal right to

              change from time to time and at any time, but any such changes
              will not affect bookings already accepted by a Prked Application.

              Services may be incorrectly priced. Prked is under no obligation
              to fulfill a Reservation, even after you have been sent
              confirmation of your Reservation. We do not guarantee that pricing
              for Reservations will be the best available at the time of
              reservation or reservation request. 4. Privacy Policy. Prked is

              operator of any property available for rent via the Services and
              is not responsible for any damage or loss to property or person
              that may occur while you are on the Host’s property or engaged in
              a Reservation with the Host. All parking transactions are entered
              into at your own risk. We cannot and do not guarantee in any way
              the security of your vehicle or its contents. It is your
              responsibility to ensure that your vehicle is properly secured. If
              your vehicle is damaged while on a Host’s property, you agree to
              first attempt to resolve the matter with the Host. If the matter
              cannot be resolved through direct contact with the Host, you may
              contact Prked customer service to record your case so that we can
              assess the situation and offer recourse where Prked, in its sole
              discretion, deems such necessary. If your vehicle is stolen,
              contact the police and your insurance provider immediately. Prked
              does not provide any insurance coverage to a User at any time.
              Certain Hosts may provide services in addition to parking,
              including but not limited to valet. These services may require you
              as a Guest to relinquish your keys to the Host. By accepting these
              terms and conditions, you acknowledge that any personal or
              property damage is the sole responsibility of the Host. Prked
              makes no representation and warrants the liability of these
              services. If a user utilizes these services and releases their
              keys, they do so at their own risk. ‍8. Payment Escrow,
              Distribution, and Chargebacks. All funds paid by you for the use
              of a Host’s property will be held in an escrow account by our
              merchant partner, Stripe Payments, until 48 hours from the
              satisfactory commencement of the Reservation. Our standard policy
              states that parking charges, minus Prked fees, will automatically
              be distributed to the Host after 48 hours from the commencement of
              the Reservation. During the 48-hour period following commencement
              of the reservation, you will have the opportunity to contact Prked
              and alert them of any issues you may have experienced leading up
              to or during the Reservation that you consider tantamount to a
              failure on the part of the Host to deliver what was promised or
              represented. We will adjudicate such matters at our sole
              discretion, and at our sole discretion may or may not elect to
              refund charges to your or withhold distribution of parking charges
              indefinitely while we investigate the matter. If we have not
              received a formal support ticket from you detailing your complaint
              and why you feel the service received was unsatisfactory within
              the 48-hour window, any right to receive a refund or any financial
              recourse in regards to that specific Reservation will expire.

              Stripe payment processing services you agree to the Stripe Payment

              the Services and becoming a Host, you appoint Prked as your agent
              for the purposes of connecting your offered space with Consumers
              in need of parking services and forming binding agreements between
              you and Consumers using the Services. You also appoint as your
              agent for the collection and distribution of your rental fees and
              you agree to pay a fee to Prked for every rental transaction for
              these services. ‍10. Legal Right to Rent Property. Prked provides
              tools and features that enable Hosts to list and rent their
              property for parking use. By using the Services to list an
              available parking space for rent, you are attesting that you are
              the legal owner/operator of the property being offered or have
              obtained the right to rent out the property. It is your
              responsibility to be aware of and abide by all local laws, codes,
              or HOA and neighborhood policies. Prked is no way responsible for
              any repercussions stemming from your failure to make yourself
              aware of and abide by your local laws and regulations. ‍11.
              Honoring of reservations, Cancellations & Penalties. All Hosts
              will have the opportunity to approve or decline reservation
              requests from Users (whether manually at the time of request or by
              pre-authorizing Prked to automatically approve all requests for
              the period of the time that the listing is available). Once you
              have approved a reservation request, you must honor the request.
              If you choose to cancel an approved request you agree to be
              subject to the Prked Cancellation Policy which is subject to
              change at Prked’s sole discretion. You also agree that Prked may
              assess penalties for failure to deliver a reserved parking space
              to another User. Penalties may include but are not limited to,

              registering your payment information with the Services, you agree
              to allow Prked to automatically charge you in accordance with

              fee structure at any time without notice. ‍13. Payment Escrow,
              Distribution, and Chargebacks. All funds paid by Consumers for the
              use of your property will be held in an escrow account by our
              merchant partner, Stripe Payments until 48 hours from the
              satisfactory commencement of the Reservation. Our standard policy
              states that parking charges, minus Prked fees, will automatically
              be distributed to the host after 48 hours from the commencement of
              the Reservation, however, during the 48-hour period following
              commencement of the Reservation, the Consumer will have the
              opportunity to contact Prked and alert them of any issues they
              experienced leading up to or during the Reservation that they
              consider tantamount to a failure on the part of the Host to
              deliver what was promised or represented. We will adjudicate such
              matters at our sole discretion and, at our sole discretion may
              elect to refund all chargers to the Consumer or withhold
              distribution of parking charges indefinitely while we investigate
              the matter. If we have not received a formal support ticket from
              you detailing your complaint and why you feel the service received
              was unsatisfactory within the 48-hour window, you will no longer
              have any right to receive a refund or any financial recourse in
              regards to that specific Reservation. We may also elect to garnish
              or withhold future parking distributions owed you for reasons that
              may include but are not limited to, reimbursement of Consumer
              chargebacks, when the chargeback was directly correlated to a
              Reservation carried out on your Listing, or penalty fees that we
              may charge for violating this set of Terms & Conditions. Prked
              uses Stripe for payment processing services. By using the Stripe
              payment processing services you agree to the Stripe Payment
              Services Agreement available at https://stripe.com/ssa ‍ 14. Usage
              Guidelines. As a Host you agree not to contact or attempt to
              contact Consumers with intent to conduct a rental transaction in
              relation to a property that you have listed with the Services by
              means other than the Services. You also agree not to use the
              Services to solicit or offer other Users goods or services of any
              kind beyond reservation and rental of parking spaces. ‍15. Damage
              to Person or Property. By consenting to this Terms & Conditions
              you acknowledge that when you enter into a rental agreement with a
              Consumer you are voluntarily granting the renting party consent to
              enter your property or a property which you have been licensed to
              operate. Wherever possible Prked will take steps to ensure that
              users and their property are safe from damage or harm, but by
              agreeing to these terms, you acknowledge that Prked is not
              responsible for any damage or loss to property or person that may
              occur while Prked users are on your property or engaged in a
              parking reservation with you. All parking transactions are entered
              into at your own risk. We cannot and do not guarantee in any way
              the security or safety of your property. It is your responsibility
              to ensure that your property is properly secured. If your property
              is damaged by another Prked user, you agree to first attempt to
              resolve the matter with the user. If the matter cannot be resolved
              through direct contact with the user, you may contact Prked
              Customer service to record your case so that we can assess the
              situation and offer recourse where possible and where we deem
              necessary. Prked does not provide any insurance coverage to any
              User at any time. You are solely responsible for obtaining the
              required insurance coverage necessary to rent out your property
              for use by others.Part III – Terms for All Services ‍16. Access to

              to provide you information regarding the Services or as otherwise
              described in our Prked Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to
              receiving such SMS text messages and are responsible for any

              platform for Users to create and publish content of their
              creation. By publishing and displaying content of any kind on the
              Prked Website or through the Prked Applications you thereby assign
              and transfer copyright, and all other rights to such content, to
              Prked. For the avoidance of doubt we are permitted to use any
              content posted by you to the Services for any of our business
              purposes. This right will still apply after the termination of
              your registration or membership. You may not use the Services for
              any unlawful purpose or any purpose that violates any local
              policies, or to publish any content that may, at Prked’s sole
              discretion, be deemed offensive, inaccurate, misleading,
              defamatory, fraudulent, or illegal. Users are not entitled to
              publish any content that could be construed as an advertisement or
              offer for anything other than parking spaces that fall within this
              set of Terms & Conditions. Prked reserves the right to remove any
              content from the Services at any time at our sole discretion and

              Complaints and Disputes Between Users. In the case of a dispute
              between you and another User, you agree that you will first
              attempt to resolve the matter through direct communication,
              through the Services, with the User. In the event that the dispute
              cannot be resolved through direct communication, you may file a
              support ticket and request that Prked assist in resolving the
              matter. By doing so you authorize Prked to deal with the dispute
              or complaint as we deem appropriate. You also authorize us to use
              any and all funds we, or our merchant partners, may be holding on
              your behalf to resolves the matter. You additionally authorize us
              to deduct funds from or charge any payment method which you have

              promotional offers. Prked may choose to offer limited-time

              eligible for referral rewards, the Users referred by you must be
              brand new unregistered Users of the Services. They must also use
              the exact code given them by you to redeem an introductory offer
              or must sign up using the email or phone number with which you
              invited them. They must also complete a transaction as a Host or
              Consumer before you can be eligible to receive rewards. The
              rewards offered may be changed by Prked at any time without
              notice. All promotional offers, coupon codes, introductory offers,
              account credits, or rewards may be changed, revoked, denied, or
              cancelled at any time without any notice and at Prked’s
              discretion, whether already granted to the User or not yet
              accrued. ‍23. Prked Promo Code Terms and Conditions. Any Prked
              promotional code or coupon in any form (the “Code”) issued by
              Prked is subject to the following terms and conditions (“Promo
              Terms”). Your receipt and/or redemption of the Code constitute
              acceptance of and agreement with these Promo Terms. Other terms
              and conditions may apply to use of the Prked Services.
              Specifically, without limitation, access to and use of the Service
              is subject to the Prked Terms & Conditions. The Code is only
              redeemable on the Services. A Code can be used only once and only
              one Code may be used per transaction. Codes are void if not
              obtained through authorized, legitimate channels, or if any part
              of the code is altered, duplicated, forged, counterfeited, or
              tampered with in any way or do not contain proper security devices
              (a “nonconforming Code”). Any attempt to obtain or generate
              multiple Codes and/or nonconforming Codes and/or to use multiple
              names, email addresses, phone numbers, and/or any fraudulent or
              other non-permissible means to obtain or use Codes, as determined
              by Prked in its sole discretion, will give Prked the right to void
              the Code and disqualify the user. The Code has no cash value, and
              cannot be exchanged for cash or credit, except as required by law
              (in which case the value of the Code is deemed $0.001). The Code
              cannot be bought or sold and is void if sold or exchanged for
              compensation. Any unused value will be forfeited. Codes cannot be
              used for past purchases of Services or offers. Codes are void
              where prohibited by law. If a Code is used in violation of these
              Terms, or if your use of the Code with the Services otherwise
              violates the Terms & Conditions, Prked reserves the right to (a)
              cancel any transaction on the Services; (b) void the value of the
              Code; and/or (c) charge your credit card for the full value of the
              Services ordered without the Code applied. PRKED AND ITS
              RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS MAKE NO
              WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY
              WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE

              RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, FROM AND

              restricted or blocked to allow for repairs, maintenance, or the
              introduction of new features. In these cases, we will attempt to
              restore access as soon as reasonably possible. Any such
              interruptions to the Service shall not constitute a breach of
              these terms by Prked. Prked will not be responsible for any
              failure or inability to make good on an agreement between and
              yourself and another User caused by a technical difficulty,
              connection or communication issue, or any interruption of the
              Services. ‍25. Modifications to Services. Prked reserves the
              right, in its sole discretion, to modify the Services from time to

              Website, Prked Applications, and/or availability of certain
              Listings. Prked shall have no liability to you for any of the
              foregoing actions. If you object to any such changes, your sole
              recourse shall be to immediately cease using the Services.
              Continued use of the Services following any such changes shall
              indicate your acknowledgment of, and consent to, such changes and
              satisfaction with all the Services. ‍26. Intellectual Property
              Rights and Grant of Rights to User. The features, information, and
              materials provided and depicted through the Services and on the

              interest is granted to User for any other purpose, and any other
              use of the Services or the Prked Content by User shall constitute
              a material breach of this Terms & Conditions. Prked and its
              partners or licensors retain all rights in and to the Services,
              Prked Content, and any associated patents, trademarks, copyrights,

              While Driving. You agree, represent, and warrant, so long as you
              use or access the Services YOU WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,
              ACCESS, VIEW, OR USE THE SERVICES WHILE DRIVING OR OTHERWISE
              OPERATING A VEHICLE OF ANY KIND (including, without limitation, a
              car, truck, motorcycle, motor scooter, or bicycle) or operating
              any dangerous equipment or machinery. You understand that using
              any handheld device in these circumstances is extremely dangerous,
              and can result in property damage, physical injuries (including
              dismemberment), or death. You further agree, represent and
              warrant, that you will not use or access the Services in any
              manner that places yourself or any other person at risk of injury,
              and that you will abide by all traffic laws. While effort is made
              to assure the accuracy of the information presented to the User,
              the User is solely responsible for safe driving and for the
              consequences of decisions as to where to travel, drive, or park.
              Under no circumstance will any of the Prked Parties (as defined
              below) assume any responsibility or liability for the consequences
              of driving decisions made by Users. You agree that no Prked Party
              shall be liable for any driving decisions made by you or at your
              suggestion, or for any damages, injury, or other harm caused by
              your use of or accessing the Services or Prked Content while
              driving, operating equipment or machinery, or otherwise in a
              dangerous and unsuitable manner, and you hereby waive any claims
              or causes of action you may have, now or in the future, arising
              from or relating to the same. IN THE EVENT THAT ANY PARTY NAMES
              ANY PRKED PARTY AS A DEFENDANT IN A CASE INVOLVING YOUR USE OF THE
              SERVICES WHILE OPERATING A VEHICLE, YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND
              HOLD ANY SUCH PRKED PARTY HARMLESS IN SUCH ACTION. ‍30. Government

              Severability. If any part of this Terms & Conditions is determined
              to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law
              including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and
              liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or
              unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
              enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the
              original provision and Agreement shall continue in effect ‍41.
              Assignment. This Terms & Conditions, and the rights granted and
              obligations undertaken hereunder, may not be transferred, assigned
              or delegated in any manner by a User, but may be freely

              waiver of any provision of this Terms & Conditions, or a delay by
              any party in the enforcement of any right hereunder, shall neither
              be construed as a continuing waiver nor create an expectation of
              non-enforcement of that or any other provision or right. ‍43.
              Arbitration and Venue. Any and all controversies, disputes,
              demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the
              interpretation and scope of this clause) between you and the Prked
              Parties or their successors or assigns shall exclusively be
              settled through binding and confidential arbitration in Palm Beach
              County, Florida.Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal
              Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration
              shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator, certified by
              the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), with substantial
              experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified
              by this Terms & Conditions, and unless otherwise agreed upon by
              the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the
              AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems
              them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
              Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”).You and Prked
              must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU
              OR PRKED MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
              NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
              REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE
              MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY
              FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD
              CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) the arbitrator shall honor claims of
              privilege and privacy recognized at law; (d) the arbitration shall
              be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the
              existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be
              required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration
              award; (e) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or
              individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (f)
              each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there
              is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be
              paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the
              fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable
              law.Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Prked may bring
              an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of
              defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and
              infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent,
              copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this
              arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in
              the state or federal courts located in Palm Beach County, Florida.
              Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either
              party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or
              federal courts located in Palm Beach County, Florida in order to
              maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to
              submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts
              located within Palm Beach County, Florida for such purpose. A
              request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the
              right to arbitrate.With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) in
              this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective
              basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be
              invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the
              Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration
              provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in
              accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable,
              illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however,
              either subpart (a) or (b) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or
              illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be
              null and void, and neither you nor Prked shall be entitled to
              arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather
              than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in
              state or federal court located in Palm Beach County, Florida.For
