              Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the
              collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive
              from Users of our website at Prked.com (the “Website”) and the
              Prked iOS mobile device application (the “App”) or any other
              products provided by Parkr Technologies, Inc. The Website, App,
              and all other Prked services are collectively referred to as the
              “Services.” This Privacy Policy applies only to information that
              you provide to us through use of the Services or by direct contact
              with a representative of Prked. By using the Services, you are
              agreeing to be bound by these policies. Our privacy policy will be

              and all updates to the privacy policy will be posted on the
              Website and within the Mobile App. ‍Key Terms ‍ Services: The

              Registered User who has created and published a Listing in the
              Services whether the owner, renter, or employee of the owner of
              that property. ‍ ‍Guest: Any Registered User who uses the Services

              In the course of using the Services, you may provide us with
              “Personally Identifiable Information.” This refers to information
              about you that can be used to contact or identify you, and
              information on your use of, and activities through, our Services
              that may be connected with you (“PII”). PII that we collect may
              include, but is not limited to, your first and last name,
              password, mobile number, email address, billing information,
              vehicle information including license plate number, details
              regarding any transaction you make or action you take using the
              Services, and information voluntarily given to us by you. PII may
              also include information you supply to us concerning your
              location, preferences, and interests expressed in the course of
              use of the Services. It is not compulsory that you provide any of
              the above information; however, if you choose not to, you will not
              be able to register as a User of the Services and will not have
              access to certain information and features or capability to
              conduct any transactions with other Prked Users. ‍ ‍Log Data. Our
              servers automatically record information about how Users (both
              account holders and non-account holders) use our Services. This
              information, referred to as “Log Data,” may include, but is not
              limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser
              type, operating system, the web page you were visiting before you
              accessed our Services, the pages or features of our Services that
              you browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search
              terms, the links on our Services that you clicked, and statistics
              related to your use of the Services. We use Log Data to administer
              the Services and to analyze (or have third parties analyze) the
              Log Data to improve, customize, and enhance our Services by
              expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to
              our Users’ needs and preferences. ‍ ‍Cookies. Like many websites,
              we also use automated data collection tools such as “cookies” and
              “web beacons” to collect certain information. “Cookies” are small
              text files that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for
              record-keeping purposes. We use “persistent cookies” to save your
              registration ID and login password for future logins to the
              Website; and we use “session ID cookies” to enable certain
              features of the Website, to better understand how you interact
              with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic
              routing on the Website. You can instruct your browser, by changing
              its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
              accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not
              accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions
              of the Website or all functionality of our Services. Note that
              this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not
              include use of cookies by third parties. ‍ ‍Third Parties. We may
              also allow third parties, including, but not limited to Google
              Analytics, to place cookies on the Website. Third parties use
              these technologies to help us analyze how you use the Website and
              to market and advertise to you on the Website and third party
              websites. These cookies also help us detect or prevent fraud or
              conduct risk assessments, or to collect information about your
              activities on the Website. To prevent Google Analytics from using
              your information for analytics, you may install the Google
              Analytics Opt-Out Browser . To opt out of Google Analytics for
              display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you
              can visit the Google Ads Settings page. We do not control any of
              these opt-out links and are not responsible for the availability
              or accuracy of these mechanisms. ‍ ‍Web Beacons. “Web Beacons”
              (also known as clear gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique
              identifier that may be included on our Services for several
              purposes, including to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
              track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how
              many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness
              of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the User’s
              hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web
              pages (or in an email). ‍ ‍Location Information. When you use the
              Services, we may collect and store information about your location
              by converting your IP address into a geographic location, or by
              accessing your device’s GPS coordinates or course location if you
              enable location services on your device. We may use location
              information to improve and personalize our Services for you. You
              may opt to not allow us to use your device’s location, but doing
              so may prevent you from being able to use some or all of features
              provided by the Services. ‍ ‍Financial Information. Prked uses
              _____________________ (“______”) to gather End User’s data from
              financial institutions. By using our service, you grant Prked and
              __________ the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf
              to access and transmit your personal and financial information
              from the relevant financial institution. You agree to your
              personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and
              processed by Plaid in accordance with the_____ Privacy Policy. As
              a Registered User of the Services, you may be also asked to enter
              billing information in the form of a Venmo account, Apple Pay
              account, credit or debit card, or other payment method (Payment
              Info) in order to transact with other Users. You may also be asked
              to connect your Venmo or bank account in order to receive payment
              for use of your parking space (Payout Info). You are not required
              to enter any financial information at any time but you will not
              have the ability to transact with other Users or collect funds
              owed to you until you have input the financial information
              requisite to the task you are attempting to perform. We will
              inform you when further financial information or other data points
              are required and request that you provide the data at that time.
              We do not store your credit/debit card info or bank account
              information on our servers. You consent to the transfer,
              collection and storage of all bank account information,
              credit/debit information, Payment Information and Payout
              Information to and by our payment processor partner, Stripe
              Payments, for payment transaction purposes. Further information
              about measures taken by Stripe Payments to keep your information
              safe and secure can be found via their website https://stripe.com
              ‍ ‍Vehicle Data. In order to reserve a parking space on your
              behalf and facilitate transactions between Guests and Hosts, we
              will request data regarding your vehicle, including make, model,
              color, year, and license plate number. Your license plate number
              will not be made publicly visible by us. ‍ ‍Listing Data. In order
              to become a Host, you will be required to create a Listing. In
              order to create and publish a Listing, you will be required input
              information specific to the Listing including but not limited to
              address, property type, business name, business type, property
              features, and hours of operation. ‍ ‍User Ratings. The Services
              provides a means for other Registered Users to rate your
              performance and behavior as a Host or Guest. We will aggregate and
              store this information. ‍ ‍How We Use PII. PII is used for the
              following purposes: (a) to provide and improve our Services,

              services offered directly by us or any entity with which we have
              formed a business relationship. This information and these
              communications may come to you in the form of email, mobile
              messaging, telephone contact, or direct mail depending upon the
              preferences which you indicate to us within your account.If you

              communications, please follow the instructions provided in any of
              the communications or update your “User Settings” information.
              (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.) We use
              information we obtain by technical means (such as the automatic
              recording performed by our servers or through the use of cookies)
              for the above purposes, and in order to monitor and analyze use of
              the Services for behavioral information and for technical
              administration of the Services, as well as to increase the
              functionality and user-friendliness of the Services, to better
              tailor the Services to your needs, to generate and derive useful
              data and information concerning the interests, characteristic,
              website and Mobile App use behavior of our Users, and to verify
              that visitors to the Services meet the criteria required to
              process their requests.We have the capability to re-utilize your
              payment information after you have completed a transaction using
              the Services for items such as recurring reservations,
              cancellation fees, and penalty fees as covered in our Terms of
              Services and Cancellation Policy. These policies are in place to
              ensure that the Services perform adequately and maintain their
              value for all Users. ‍ ‍Information Sharing and
              Disclosure.Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your
              Request. We will display portions of your PII in your profile page
              and elsewhere throughout the Services according to the preferences
              you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide
              should reflect how much you want all other Prked Users to know
              about you. We will share your PII with third-party websites or
              platforms, such as social networking websites, if you have
              requested that we do so. ‍ ‍Information Shared to Facilitate
              Transactions on Your Behalf. When you utilize the Services to
              request a parking reservation with a Host, or when you publish
              your Listing in order to begin accepting reservations, we will
              share specific data points and PII about you or your Listing with
              the specific Hosts that you have requested a reservation with or
              with any Guest who searches for available parking in the area of
              your Listing. Data shared with other Users may include but is not
              limited to past User ratings, Listing address, features, and
              hours, vehicle, make, model, year, and color. Your financial
              information will not be shared with or made visible to other
              Users. Your license plate number will not be made visible, but may
              be used as a blind verification tool. (Example: Host sees your car
              on his/her property and wants to verify that you are a Guest with
              an approved reservation. The Host may enter your plate number and
              the Services will compare their entry to your plate number and
              inform them whether it is a match or not.) ‍ ‍Information Shared
              with Services Providers and Analysts. We may engage third-party
              service providers to work with us to administer and provide the
              Services. These third-party service providers may have access to
              your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf
              and are expressly obligated by agreement, statute and/or
              applicable regulations not to disclose or use your PII for any
              other purpose. We may share aggregated information and
              non-identifying information with third parties for purposes that
              include, but are not limited to, industry research and analysis,
              demographic profiling, and other similar purposes. ‍ ‍Information
              Disclosed in Connection With Business Transactions. Information
              that we collect from our Users, including PII, is considered to be
              a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business, enter
              bankruptcy, or are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a
              merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or
              transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the
              transaction. In such an event we will take the steps we deem
              appropriate to ensure that your privacy rights remain protected. ‍
              ‍Information Disclosed to Protect Us and Others. We cooperate with
              government and law enforcement officials or private parties to
              enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information
              about you to government or law enforcement officials, or private
              parties as we, at our sole discretion, believe necessary or
              appropriate to: (a) respond to claims, or legal process (including
              subpoenas); (b) protect our property, rights and safety, and the
              property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in
              general; and (c) stop any activity that we consider illegal,
              unethical, or legally actionable. ‍ ‍Changing or Deleting Your
              Information. All Registered Users may review, update, correct, or
              delete the PII provided in their registration or account profile
              by contacting us at help@Prked.com or by changing their User
              profile information. If you completely delete all such
              information, then your account may become deactivated. ‍
              ‍Security. We take reasonable administrative, physical, and
              electronic measures designed to protect the information that we
              collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized
              access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no
              method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing
              information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee
              the absolute security of any information. By agreeing to our Terms
              of Services, you agree to indemnify and hold Prked and any
              affiliated entities harmless, in the event that your PII is
              accessed by an unauthorized party as a result of using the
              Services. ‍ ‍Our Policy Regarding Children. The Services are not
              directed to children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly
              collect personally identifiable information from children under
              the age of 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or
              her child has provided us with PII without their consent, he or
              she should contact us at help@Prked.com. If we become aware that a
              child under 18 has provided us with PII, we will delete such
              information from our files. ‍ ‍Contacting Us. If you have any
              questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
